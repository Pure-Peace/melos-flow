## Start

**Install**

```bash
yarn
```

yarn do <script name>
```

**Build js/ts sdk**

```bash
yarn build
```

**Generate esm/cjs/ts code used by sdk based on cadence script and transaction**

```bash
yarn prepare
```

**[Deploy / Update] project to flow [testnet / mainnet]**

1. Create `flow.json` corresponding to the network in the directory, such as: `flow.testnet.json` or `flow.mainnet.json`
2. Modify the `accounts` and `deployments` in the configuration file, configure the account for deployment and the contract that needs to be deployed
